<h1>Predicting Patient Readmissions to Prevent HRRP Penalties</h1>

<h3>üìå Problem Statement</h3>
Preventable hospital readmissions are a major challenge in healthcare, leading to financial penalties under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP). Hospitals with high 30-day readmission rates for conditions like heart failure, pneumonia, and COPD face up to a 3% reduction in Medicare reimbursements. Identifying high-risk patients before discharge is essential to reducing readmission rates and improving patient care.


<h3>üè• Solution Approach</h3>
This project utilizes machine learning and predictive analytics to identify patients at risk of readmission within 28 days. The approach includes:

* Data Analysis & Visualization ‚Üí Understanding key factors influencing readmissions.
* Feature Selection ‚Üí Using SHAP & Random Forest to extract the most important features.
* Model Development ‚Üí Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).
* Handling Class Imbalance ‚Üí Implementing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to improve recall and ensure high-risk patients are correctly identified.


This solution enables hospitals to proactively intervene with better discharge planning, targeted monitoring, and improved patient care‚Äîultimately helping to reduce readmissions and mitigate HRRP penalties.
